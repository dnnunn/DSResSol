This folder includes 3 ipynb for feature extractions from the protein sequences. in "scratch data code. ipynb" we computed the biological features related to SS and RSA which we received from the SCRATCH software. Also, we calculated some other main biological feature such as molecular weight and etc.

In "frequency amino acid. ipynb" we calculated the frequency of amino acid in each protein sequence

In "disorder.ipynb" we computed the disorder related features from the file which we received from the Spritz software for disorder features.
