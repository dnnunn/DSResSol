# DSResSol Integration: Next Steps Log

_Last updated: 2025-07-12_

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Batch Prediction Testing**
   - Run DSResSol CLI with a FASTA file containing custom headers (e.g., fusion offspring names).
   - Verify output CSV preserves these names in the `name` column.
   - Confirm output columns: `name`, `sequence`, `solubility`, `prediction`.

2. **PeptideFrontEnd Integration Validation**
   - Use the output CSV as input for PeptideFrontEnd's GA pipeline.
   - Ensure naming and output format are accepted without modification.
   - Test with sequences generated by the GA (including fusion offspring with unique names).

3. **Documentation & Communication**
   - Update developer documentation to clarify the importance of the `name` field.
   - Note that all predictors must output `name`, `sequence`, `solubility`, `prediction`.
   - Document test results and any issues found during integration.

## Medium-Term Tasks

- Prepare example FASTA and CSV files for integration testing.
- Develop scripts for automated batch prediction and output validation.
- Monitor for any downstream issues in PeptideFrontEnd caused by naming or output format.
- Coordinate with PeptideFrontEnd maintainers if any changes are required.

## Long-Term Considerations

- Maintain output schema alignment as predictors evolve.
- Periodically review PeptideFrontEnd GA pipeline for changes in input/output requirements.
- Consider adding versioning to output files for traceability.
